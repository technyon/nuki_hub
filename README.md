## About

***The scope of Nuki Hub is to have an efficient way to integrate Nuki devices in a local Home Automation platform.***

The Nuki Hub software runs on a ESP32 module and acts as a bridge between Nuki devices and a Home Automation platform.<br>
<br>
It communicates with a Nuki Lock and/or Opener through Bluetooth (BLE) and uses MQTT to integrate with other systems.<br>
<br>
It exposes the lock state (and much more) through MQTT and allows executing commands like locking and unlocking as well as changing the Nuki Lock/Opener configuration through MQTT.<br>

***Nuki Hub does not integrate with the Nuki mobile app, it can't register itself as a bridge in the official Nuki mobile app.***

See the "[Connecting via Ethernet](#connecting-via-ethernet-optional)" section for more information.

## Recommended ESP32 devices

We don't recommend using single-core ESP32 devices (ESP32-C3, ESP32-C6, ESP32-H2, ESP32-Solo1).<br>
Although Nuki Hub supports single-core devices, Nuki Hub uses both CPU cores (if available) to process tasks (e.g. HTTP server/MQTT client/BLE scanner/BLE client) and thus runs much better on dual-core devices.<br>

When buying a new device in 2025 we can only recommend the ESP32-S3 with PSRAM (look for an ESP32-S3 with the designation N>=4 and R>=2 such as an ESP32-S3 N16R8).<br>
The ESP32-S3 is a dual-core CPU with many GPIO's, ability to enlarge RAM using PSRAM, ability to connect Ethernet modules over SPI and optionally power the device with a PoE splitter.<br>
The only functions missing from the ESP32-S3 as compared to other ESP devices is the ability to use some Ethernet modules only supported by the original ESP32 (and ESP32-P4) and the ability to connect over WIFI6 (C6 or ESP32-P4 with C6 module)

If/When the ESP32-P4 with ESP32-C6-MINI-1 module for BLE/WiFi is supported this will probably become the preferred device for Nuki Hub.

Other considerations:
- If Ethernet/PoE is required: An ESP32-S3 with PSRAM in combination with a SPI Ethernet module ([W5500](https://www.aliexpress.com/w/wholesale-w5500.html)) and [PoE to Ethernet and USB type B/C splitter](https://aliexpress.com/w/wholesale-poe-splitter-usb-c.html) or the LilyGO-T-ETH ELite, LilyGO-T-ETH-Lite-ESP32S3 or M5stack Atom S3R with the M5stack AtomPoe W5500 module
- If WIFI6 is absolutely required (it probably isn't): ESP32-C6

Devices ranked best-to-worst:
- ESP32-S3 with PSRAM
- ......
- ......
- ESP32 with PSRAM
- ......<br>
(Devices below will not support some Nuki Hub functions)

<br>
This project is free to use for everyone. However if you feel like donating, you can buy me a coffee at ko-fi.com:<br>
[![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/C0C1IDUBV)

## First time installation

Flash the firmware to an ESP32. The easiest way to install is to use the web installer using a compatible browser like Chrome/Opera/Edge:<br>
https://technyon.github.io/nuki_hub/<br>
NOTE: Webflash is not available for the ESP32-Solo1<br>
<br>
Alternatively download the latest release for your ESP32 model from https://github.com/technyon/nuki_hub/releases<br>
Unpack the zip archive and read the included how-to-flash.txt for installation instructions for either "Espressif Flash Download Tools" or "esptool".<br>

## Initial setup (Network and MQTT)

Power up the ESP32 and a new Wi-Fi access point named "NukiHub" should appear.<br>
The password of the access point is "NukiHubESP32".<br>
Connect a client device to this access point and in a browser navigate to "http://192.168.4.1".<br>
Use the web interface to connect the ESP to your preferred Wi-Fi network.<br>
<br>
After configuring Wi-Fi, the ESP should automatically connect to your network.<br>
<br>
To configure the connection to the MQTT broker, first connect your client device to the same Wi-Fi network the ESP32 is connected to.<br>
In a browser navigate to the IP address assigned to the ESP32 via DHCP (often found in the web interface of your internet router) or static IP.<br><br>
Next click on "MQTT Configuration" and enter the address and port (usually 1883) of your MQTT broker and a username and password if required by your MQTT broker.<br>
<br>
The firmware supports SSL encryption for MQTT.<br>
See the "[MQTT Encryption](#mqtt-encryption-optional)" section of this README.

## Pairing with a Nuki Lock (1.0-4.0) or Opener

Make sure "Bluetooth pairing" is enabled for the Nuki device by enabling this setting in the official Nuki App in "Settings" > "Features & Configuration" > "Button and LED".
After enabling the setting press the button on the Nuki device for a few seconds.<br>
Pairing should be automatic whenever the ESP32 is powered on and no lock is paired.<br>
To pair with an opener you need to first enable the opener on the "Nuki configuration" page of Nuki Hub.<br>
<br>
When pairing is successful, the web interface should show "Paired: Yes".<br>
MQTT nodes like lock state and battery level should now reflect the reported values from the lock.<br>
<br>
<b>Note: It is possible to run Nuki Hub alongside a Nuki Bridge.
This is not recommended (unless when using [hybrid mode](/HYBRID.md)) and will lead to excessive battery drain and can lead to either device missing updates.
Enable "Register as app" before pairing to allow this. Otherwise the Bridge will be unregistered when pairing the Nuki Hub.</b>

## Pairing with a Nuki Lock Ultra

Make sure "Bluetooth pairing" is enabled for the Nuki device by enabling this setting in the official Nuki App in "Settings" > "Features & Configuration" > "Button and LED".

Before enabling pairing mode using the button on the Lock Ultra first setup Nuki Hub as follows:
- Enable both "Nuki Smartlock enabled" and "Nuki Smartlock Ultra enabled" settings on the "Basic Nuki Configuration" page and Save. Setting the "Nuki Smartlock Ultra enabled" will change multiple other NukiHub settings.
- Input your 6-digit Nuki Lock Ultra PIN on the "Credentials" page and Save
- Press the button on the Nuki device for a few seconds until the LED ring lights up and remains lit.
- It is **strongly** recommended(/mandatory) to setup and enable Hybrid mode over Thread/WiFi + official MQTT as Nuki Hub works best in Hybrid or Bridge mode and the Ultra does not support Bridge mode

When pairing is successful, the web interface should show "Paired: Yes".<br>

## Hybrid mode

Hybrid mode allows you to use the official Nuki MQTT implemenation on a Nuki Lock 3.0 Pro, Nuki Lock 4.0, Nuki Lock 4.0 Pro or Nuki Lock Ultra in conjunction with Nuki Hub.<br>
See [hybrid mode](/HYBRID.md) for more information.

## Memory constraints

ESP32 devices have a limited amount of free RAM available.<br>
<br>
On version >=9.00 of Nuki Hub with only a Nuki Lock connected the expected free amount of RAM/Heap available is around:
- ESP32: 60 kilobytes / 60.000 bytes
- Other variants (C3/S3/C6/H2): 90-120 kilobytes / 90.000-120.000 bytes

This free amount of RAM can be reduced (temporarily) by certain actions (such as changing Nuki device config) or continuously when enabling the following:
- Connecting both a Nuki opener and a Nuki lock to Nuki Hub
- Enlarging stack sizes of the Nuki and Network task to accommodate large amounts of keypad codes, authorization entries or timecontrol entries
- MQTT SSL (Costs about 30k RAM)
- HTTP SSL (Costs about 30k RAM)
- Developing/debugging Nuki devices and/or Nuki Hub, using WebSerial (Costs about 30k RAM)

The currently available RAM/Heap can be found on the info page of the Web configurator of Nuki Hub.<br>
<br>
When the ESP32 runs out of available RAM the device can crash or otherwise unexpected behaviour can occur.<br>
<br>
Nuki Hub does allow for the use of embedded PSRAM on the regular binaries whenever it is available.<br>
PSRAM is usually 2, 4 or 8MB in size and thus greatly enlarges the 320kb of internal RAM that is available.<br>
It is basically impossible to run out of RAM when PSRAM is available.
You can check on the info page of the Web configurator if PSRAM is available.

Note that there are two builds of Nuki Hub for the ESP32-S3 available.<br>
One for devices with no or Quad SPI PSRAM and one for devices with Octal SPI PSRAM.<br>
Webflash will automatically flash the no/Quad SPI PSRAM build when an ESP32-S3 is connected.<br>
If your ESP32-S3 device has PSRAM but it is not detected please switch to the other S3 binary.<br>
You can do this by flashing the correct binaries manually or by selecting the option to switch S3 binary build from the Firmware Update page of the Web Configurator.

Note that there are also is a separate build of Nuki Hub available for the GL-S10 ESP32 which is needed to enable PSRAM on this device (BETA).<br>

Create a (partial) backup of the current Nuki Hub settings by selecting any of the following:<br>
- Basic export: Will backup all settings that are not considered confidential (as such passwords and pincodes are not included in this export).
- Export with redacted settings: Will backup basic settings and redacted settings such as passwords and pincodes.

Both of the above options will not backup pairing data, so you will have to manually pair Nuki devices when importing this export on a factory reset or new device.

- Export with redacted settings and pairing data: Will backup all settings and pairing data. Can be used to completely restore a factory reset or new device based on the settings of this device. (Re)pairing Nuki devices will not be needed when importing this export.

- Export HTTP SSL certificate and key (PSRAM devices only): Export your HTTP server SSL certificate and key
- Export MQTT SSL CA, client certificate and client key: Export your MQTT SSL CA and client certificate and client key
- Export Coredump: Export the complete log gathered from the last ESP crash

<br>
To import settings copy and paste the contents of the JSON file that is created by any of the above export options and select "Import".
After importing the device will reboot.

### Advanced Configuration

The advanced configuration menu is not reachable from the main menu of the web configurator by default.<br>
You can reach the menu directly by browsing to http://NUKIHUBIP/get?page=advanced or enable showing it in the main menu by browsing to http://NUKIHUBIP/get?page=debugon once (http://NUKIHUBIP/get?page=debugoff to disable).

## Import and Export Nuki Hub settings over MQTT (BETA)

Consider this when deciding if you want to enable the following functionality:

- Any application/actor that has read access to `nukihub/configuration/action` and `nukihub/configuration/json` can view your changes and exports.
- If you have not enabled the setting to require MFA when changing settings any application/actor that has write access to `nukihub/configuration/action` can change Nuki Hub settings (including pairing data and credentials)

### Export Nuki Hub settings over MQTT

To allow Nuki Hub to export configuration over MQTT first enable "Publish Nuki Hub configuration information" in "Access Level Configuration" and save the configuration.
You can export Nuki Hub settings in JSON format by sending the following JSON values to the `nukihub/configuration/action` topic:
- Export Nuki Hub settings without redacted settings and without pairing settings:  `{"exportNH": 0}`

NOTE: The following settings can only be exported if you have setup a secure MQTT connection (MQTT over SSL)

- Export Nuki Hub settings with redacted settings and without pairing settings: `{"exportNH": 0, "redacted": 1}`
- Export Nuki Hub settings without redacted settings and with pairing settings: `{"exportNH": 0, "pairing": 1}`
- Export Nuki Hub settings with redacted settings and pairing settings: `{"exportNH": 0, "redacted": 1, "pairing": 1}`
- Export Nuki Hub MQTTS certificates and key: `{"exportMQTTS": 0}`
- Export Nuki Hub HTTPS certificate and key: `{"exportHTTPS": 0}`

The exported values will be available in the `nukihub/configuration/json` topic in JSON format.
A general explanation of the exported values can be found in the [PreferencesKeys.h](/src/PreferencesKeys.h) file

If you set the value of `exportNH`/`exportMQTTS`/`exportHTTPS` to an integer value > 0 the `nukihub/configuration/json` will be cleared after the given amount of seconds (e.g. `{"exportMQTTS": 30}` will clear the JSON topic after 30 seconds)

If you have enabled `Require MFA (Duo/TOTP) authentication for all sensitive Nuki Hub operations (changing/exporting settings)` you will need to either provide a currently valid TOTP code as part of the sent JSON in the `totp` node or approve the Duo Push before the settings will be exported.

### Import/Change Nuki Hub settings over MQTT

To allow Nuki Hub to import/change configuration over MQTT first enable "Modify Nuki Hub configuration over MQTT" in "Access Level Configuration" and save the configuration.
You can import Nuki Hub settings in JSON format by sending the desired JSON values to be changed to the `nukihub/configuration/action` topic.
The expected values and format is the same as the JSON files/values that can be exported over MQTT or through the Web Configurator.

The result of the import will be available in the `nukihub/configuration/commandResult` topic in JSON format.
After the import is complete the ESP32 will reboot.

If you have enabled `Require MFA (Duo/TOTP) authentication for all sensitive Nuki Hub operations (changing/exporting settings)` you will need to either provide a currently valid TOTP code as part of the sent JSON in the `totp` node or approve the Duo Push before the settings will be changed/imported.

Note: When importing settings using MQTT there are less/no checks on the values entered. These checks are only available when changing settings through the WebConfigurator.
Consider testing your configuration values by changing them in the Web Configurator before trying to use MQTT to change configuration.
A general explanation of the values that can be imported can be found in the [PreferencesKeys.h](/src/PreferencesKeys.h) file

## Changing Nuki Lock/Opener Configuration

To change Nuki Lock/Opener settings set the `configuration/action` topic to a JSON formatted value with any of the following settings. Multiple settings can be changed at once. See [Nuki Bluetooh API](https://developer.nuki.io/t/bluetooth-api/27) for more information on the available settings.<br>
Changing settings has to enabled first in the configuration portal. Check the settings you want to be able to change under "Nuki Lock/Opener Config Control" in "Access Level Configuration" and save the configuration.

- `{ "fobAction1": "Unlock", "fobAction2": "Intelligent", "nightModeImmediateLockOnStart": "1" }`

### Result of attempted configuration changes

The result of the last configuration change action will be published to the `configuration/commandResult` MQTT topic as JSON data.<br>
<br>
The JSON data will include a node called "general" and a node for every setting that Nuki Hub detected in the action.<br>
Possible values for the "general" node are "noValidPinSet", "invalidJson", "invalidConfig", "success" and "noChange".<br>
Possible values for the node per setting are "unchanged", "noValueSet", "invalidValue", "valueTooLong", "accessDenied", "success", "failed", "timeOut", "working", "notPaired", "error" and "undefined"<br>
<br>
Example:
- `{"advertisingMode":"success","general":"success"}`

### Home Assistant discovery

If Home Assistant discovery is enabled (see the [Home  Assistant Discovery](#home-assistant-discovery-optional) section of this README) Nuki Hub will create entities for almost all of the above settings.

## Upgrading using Over-the-air Update (OTA)

After the initial installation of the Nuki Hub firmware via serial connection, further updates can be deployed via OTA update from a browser.<br>
In the configuration portal, select "Firmware update" from the main page.<br>
<br>
The easiest way to upgrade Nuki Hub, if Nuki Hub is connected to the internet, is to select "Update to latest version".<br>
This will download the latest Nuki Hub and Nuki Hub updater and automatically upgrade both applications.<br>
Nuki Hub will reboot 3 times during this process, which will take about 5 minutes.<br>
If you have enabled "Allow updating using MQTT" you can also use the Home Assistant updater or write "1" to the `nukihub/maintanance/update` topic to start the update process.<br>
<br>
Alternatively you can select a binary file from your file system to update Nuki Hub or the Nuki Hub updator manually<br>
You can only update Nuki Hub from the Nuki Hub updater and update the updater only from Nuki Hub<br>
You can reboot from Nuki Hub to the updater and vice versa by selecting the reboot option from the "Firware update" page<br>
When you are on the right application you can upload the new binary by clicking on "Browse" and select the new "nuki_hub\[board\].bin" or "nuki_hub_updater\[board\].bin" file and select "Upload file".<br>
After about a minute the new firmware should be installed afterwhich the ESP will reboot automatically to the updated binary.<br>
Selecting the wrong binary will lead to an unsuccessfull update<br>
<br>
<b> Note for users upgrading from Nuki Hub 8.35 or lower:</b><br>
Updating to version 9.00 requires a change to the partition table of the ESP32.<br>
Please follow the instructions for the [First time installation](#first-time-installation) one time when updating to Nuki Hub 9.00 from an earlier version.<br>

## MQTT Encryption (optional)

The communication via MQTT can be SSL encrypted.<br>
To enable SSL encryption, supply the necessary information in the MQTT Configuration page.<br>
<br>
The following configurations are supported:<br>
CA, CERT and KEY are empty -> No encryption<br>
CA is filled but CERT and KEY are empty -> Encrypted MQTT<br>
CA, CERT and KEY are filled -> Encrypted MQTT with client vaildation<br>
<br>
Example certificate creation for your MQTT server:
```console
# make a ca key
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out ca.key

# make a CA cert
openssl req -new -x509 -days 3650 -key ca.key -out ca.crt -subj "/C=US/ST=YourState/L=YourCity/O=YourOrganization/OU=YourUnit/CN=YourCAName"

# make a server key
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out server.key

# Make a sign request, MAKE SURE THE CN MATCHES YOUR MQTT SERVERNAME
openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr -subj "/C=US/ST=YourState/L=YourCity/O=YourOrganization/OU=YourUnit/CN=homeserver.local"

# sign it
 openssl x509 -req -in server.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out server.crt -days 3650
```

## HTTPS Server (optional, PSRAM enabled devices only)

The Webconfigurator can use/force HTTPS on PSRAM enabled devices.<br>
To enable SSL encryption, supply the certificate and key in the Network configuration page.<br>
You can also let Nuki Hub generate a self-signed certificate by clicking "Generate" on the Network configuration page.<br>
Reboot Nuki Hub afterwards to enable to HTTPS server (and disable HTTP).<br>

Example self-signed certificate creation for your HTTPS server:
```console

# make a Certificate and key pair, MAKE SURE THE CN MATCHES THE DOMAIN AT WHICH NUKI HUB IS AVAILABLE
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 3650 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout nukihub.key -out nukihub.crt -subj "/C=US/ST=YourState/L=YourCity/O=YourOrganization/OU=YourUnit/CN=YourCAName"

```

Although you can use the HTTPS server in this way your client device will not trust the certificate by default.
An option would be to configure a proxy SSL server (such as Caddy, Traefik, nginx) with a non-self signed (e.g. let's encrypt) SSL certificate and have this proxy server connect to Nuki Hub over SSL and trust the self-signed NukiHub certificate for this connection.

## Home Assistant Discovery (optional)

This software supports [MQTT Discovery](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/discovery/) for integrating Nuki Hub with Home Assistant.<br>
To enable autodiscovery, enable the checkbox on the "MQTT Configuration" page.<br>
Once enabled, the Nuki Lock and/or Opener and related entities should automatically appear in your Home Assistant MQTT devices.

The following mapping between Home Assistant services and Nuki commands is setup when enabling autodiscovery:
|             | Smartlock | Opener (default)          | Opener (alternative)      |
|-------------|-----------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| lock.lock   | Lock      | Disable Ring To Open      | Disable Continuous Mode   |
| lock.unlock | Unlock    | Enable Ring To Open       | Enable Continuous Mode    |
| lock.open   | Unlatch   | Electric Strike Actuation | Electric Strike Actuation |

NOTE: MQTT Discovery uses retained MQTT messages to store devices configurations.<br>
In order to avoid orphan configurations on your broker please disable autodiscovery first if you no longer want to use this software.<br>
Retained messages are automatically cleared when unpairing and when changing/disabling autodiscovery topic in MQTT Configuration page.<br>
If you experience "ghost" entities/devices related to Nuki Hub you can completely purge Nuki Hub related Home Assistant discovery topics from your MQTT broker by following the instructions [here](#purging-home-assistant-discovery-mqtt-topics)

## Keypad control using JSON (optional)

If a keypad is connected to the lock, keypad codes can be added, updated and removed. This has to enabled first in the configuration portal. Check "Add, modify and delete keypad codes" under "Access Level Configuration" and save the configuration.

Information about current keypad codes is published as JSON data to the "[lock/opener]/keypad/json" MQTT topic.<br>
This needs to be enabled separately by checking "Publish keypad codes information" under "Access Level Configuration" and saving the configuration.
For security reasons, the code itself is not published, unless this is explicitly enabled in the Nuki Hub settings.
By default a maximum of 10 entries are published.

To change Nuki Lock/Opener keypad settings set the `[lock/opener]/keypad/actionJson` topic to a JSON formatted value containing the following nodes.

| Node             | Delete   | Add      | Update   |  Check   | Usage                                                                                                            | Possible values                        |

### Result of attempted keypad code changes

The result of the last keypad change action will be published to the `[lock/opener]/configuration/commandResultJson` MQTT topic.<br>
Possible values are "noValidPinSet", "keypadControlDisabled", "keypadNotAvailable", "keypadDisabled", "invalidConfig", "invalidJson", "noActionSet", "invalidAction", "noExistingCodeIdSet", "noNameSet", "noValidCodeSet", "noCodeSet", "invalidAllowedFrom", "invalidAllowedUntil", "invalidAllowedFromTime", "invalidAllowedUntilTime", "success", "failed", "timeOut", "working", "notPaired", "error" and "undefined".<br>

## Keypad control (alternative, optional)

If a keypad is connected to the lock, keypad codes can be added, updated and removed.
This has to enabled first in the configuration portal. Check "Add, modify and delete keypad codes" under "Access Level Configuration" and save the configuration.

Information about codes is published under "keypad/code_x", x starting from 0 up the number of configured codes. This needs to be enabled separately by checking "Publish keypad codes information" under "Access Level Configuration" and saving the configuration.
By default a maximum of 10 entries are published.

For security reasons, the code itself is not published, unless this is explicitly enabled in the Nuki Hub settings. To modify keypad codes, a command
structure is setup under keypad/command:

- keypad/command/id: The id of an existing code, found under keypad_code_x
- keypad/command/name: Display name of the code
- keypad/command/code: The actual 6-digit keypad code
- keypad/command/enabled: Set to 1 to enable the code, 0 to disable
- keypad/command/action: The action to execute. Possible values are add, delete and update

To modify keypad codes, the first four parameter nodes have to be set depending on the command:

- To add a code, set name, code, enabled **
- To delete a code, set id
- To update a code, set id, name, code, enabled

** Note: Rules for codes are:
- The code must be a 6 digit number
- The code can't contain 0
- The code can't start with 12

After setting the necessary parameters, write the action to be executed to the command node.
For example, to add a code:
- write "John Doe" to name
- write 111222 to code
- write 1 to enabled
- write "add" to action

## Timecontrol using JSON (optional)

Timecontrol entries can be added, updated and removed. This has to enabled first in the configuration portal. Check "Add, modify and delete timecontrol entries" under "Access Level Configuration" and save the configuration.

Information about current timecontrol entries is published as JSON data to the "[lock/opener]/timecontrol/json" MQTT topic.<br>
This needs to be enabled separately by checking "Publish timecontrol entries information" under "Access Level Configuration" and saving the configuration.
By default a maximum of 10 entries are published.

To change Nuki Lock/Opener timecontrol settings set the `[lock/opener]/timecontrol/actionJson` topic to a JSON formatted value containing the following nodes.

| Node             | Delete   | Add      | Update   | Usage                                                                                    | Possible values                                                |

- Add: `{ "action": "add", "weekdays": [ "wed", "thu", "fri" ], "time": "08:00", "lockAction": "Unlock" }`
- Update: `{ "action": "update", "entryId": "1234", "enabled": "1", "weekdays": [ "mon", "tue", "sat", "sun" ], "time": "08:00", "lockAction": "Lock" }`

## Authorization entries control using JSON (optional)

Authorization entries can be updated and removed. This has to enabled first in the configuration portal. Check "Modify and delete authorization entries" under "Access Level Configuration" and save the configuration.
It is currently not (yet) possible to add authorization entries this way.

Information about current authorization entries is published as JSON data to the "[lock/opener]/authorization/json" MQTT topic.<br>
This needs to be enabled separately by checking "Publish authorization entries information" under "Access Level Configuration" and saving the configuration.
By default a maximum of 10 entries are published.

To change Nuki Lock/Opener authorization settings set the `[lock/opener]/authorization/action` topic to a JSON formatted value containing the following nodes.

## GPIO lock control (optional)

The lock can be controlled via GPIO. To trigger actions, a connection to ground has to be present for at least 300ms (or to +3.3V for "General input (pull-down)"). <br>
<br>
To enable GPIO control, go the the "GPIO Configuration" page where each GPIO can e configured for a specific role:
- Disabled: The GPIO is disabled
- Input: Lock: When connect to Ground, a lock command is sent to the lock
- Input: Unlock: When connect to Ground, an unlock command is sent to the lock
- Input: Unlatch: When connect to Ground, an unlatch command is sent to the lock
- Input: Lock n Go: When connect to Ground, a Lock n Go command is sent to the lock
- Input: Lock n Go and unlatch: When connect to Ground, a Lock n Go and unlatch command is sent to the lock
- Input: Electric strike actuation: When connect to Ground, an electric strike actuation command is sent to the opener (open door for configured amount of time)
- Input: Activate RTO: When connect to Ground, Ring-to-open is activated (opener)
- Input: Activate CM: When connect to Ground, Continuous mode is activated (opener)
- Input: Deactivate RTO/CM: Disable RTO or CM, depending on which is active (opener)
- Input: Dectivate RTO: When connect to Ground, Ring-to-open is deactivated (opener)
- Input: Dectivate CM: When connect to Ground, Continuous mode is deactivated (opener)
- Output: High when locked: Outputs a high signal when the door is locked
- Output: High when unlocked: Outputs a high signal when the door is unlocked
- Output: High when motor blocked: Outputs a high signal when the motor is blocked (lock)
- Output: High when RTO active: Outputs a high signal when ring-to-open is active (opener)
- Output: High when CM active: Outputs a high signal when continuous mode is active (opener)
- Output: High when RTO or CM active: Outputs a high signal when either ring-to-open or continuous mode is active (opener)
- General input (pull-down): The pin is configured in pull-down configuration and its state is published to the "gpio/pin_x/state" topic
- General input (pull-up): The pin is configured in pull-up configuration and its state is published to the "gpio/pin_x/state" topic
- Genral output: The pin is set to high or low depending on the "gpio/pin_x/state" topic

## Connecting via Ethernet (Optional)

If you prefer to connect to via Ethernet instead of Wi-Fi, you either use one of the supported ESP32 modules with built-in ethernet (see "[Supported devices](#supported-devices)" section)
or wire a seperate SPI Ethernet module.<Br>
Currently the Wiznet W5x00 Module (W5100, W5200, W5500), DN9051 and KSZ8851SNL chips are supported.<br>
To use a supported module, flash the firmware, connect via Wi-Fi and select the correct network hardware in the "Network Configuration" section.

To wire an external W5x00 module to the ESP, use this wiring scheme:

- Connect W5x00 to ESP32 SPI:<br>
  - W5x00 SCK to GPIO 8<br>
  - W5x00 MISO to GPIO 9<br>
  - W5x00 MOSI to GPIO 10<br>
  - W5x00 CS/SS to GPIO 5<br>
  Optional:
  - W5x00 RST to GPIO 4<br>
  - W5x00 INT/IRQ to GPIO 3<br>

Now connect via Wi-Fi and change the network hardware to "Generic W5500".<br>

If Ethernet hardware isn't detected or initialised properly after changing the network device, Wi-Fi will be used as a fallback.<br>
<br>
Note: LAN8720 modules are only supported on the ESP32 and ESP32-Solo1, not on the ESP32-S3, ESP32-C3 or ESP-C6<br>

## FAQ / Troubleshooting

### Pairing with the lock (or opener) doesn't work

First, make sure the firmware version of the Nuki device is up-to-date, older versions have issues pairing.<br>

Check that pairing is allowed. In the Nuki smartphone app, go to "Settings" --> "Features & Configuration" --> "Button & LED" and make sure "Bluetooh Pairing" is enabled.<br>
Next press the button for several seconds untill the LED light remains lit.

On some devices, such as the [M5Stack PoESP32 Unit](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/unit/poesp32) the Bluetooth reception is very poor (range less than one meter).<br>
The reason is that some modules do not have an antenna on the PCB, but only an IPEX connector.<br>
By retrofitting an external SMA antenna (IPEX, or other names U.FL, IPAX, IPX, AMC, MHF, UMCC), Bluetooth/Wi-Fi works over several meters.<br>

### In Home Assistant, the lock/opener is shown as unavailable

Make sure you are using at least version 2023.8.0 of Home Assistant.<br>
The Home Assistant developers have made changes to MQTT auto discovery which break support for older version and Nuki Hub has adopted these changes.<br>
This unfortunately means that older versions of Home Assistant are not supported by the Nuki Hub discovery implementation anymore.

### Purging Home Assistant discovery MQTT topics

- Download the latest version of MQTT Explorer for your system from https://mqtt-explorer.com/
- Run MQTT Explorer and connect to your MQTT broker
- Enter `ids":["nuki_` in the MQTT explorer search bar
- Click on the root `homeassistant` topic
- Press delete on your keyboard
- Click Yes to confirm deletion
- Reboot all Nuki Hub devices connected to the MQTT broker to recreate the correct topics for Home Assistant

### Nuki Hub in bridge mode doesn't work when Thread or Wi-Fi on a Nuki Smartlock (3.0 Pro / 4.0 / 4.0 Pro) is turned on.

According to Nuki this is by design and part of the specification of Wi-Fi/Thread enabled locks.<br>
You can use either the built-in Wi-Fi/Thread or a Bridge (which Nuki Hub registers as), using both at the same time is not supported.<br>
Or you can use Nuki Hub in Hybrid mode using Wi-Fi or Thread, see [hybrid mode](/HYBRID.md)<br>

### Certain functionality doesn't work (e. g. changing configuration, setting keypad codes)

Some functionality is restricted by the Lock (or Opener) firmware and is only accessible when the PIN is provided.<br>
When first setting up the lock (or opener), you have to set a PIN in the Nuki smartphone app.<br>
Navigate to the Nuki Hub Credentials page, enter this PIN, click save and reboot.<br>
Check the main page of the configurator to see if the entered PIN is valid.

Also make sure that the you have enabled the specific functionality on the "Access Level Configuration" page of Nuki Hub.

### Authorization data isn't published

See the previous point, this functionality needs the correct PIN to be configured.

### Using Home Assistant, it's only possible to lock or unlock the door, but not to unlatch it

Make sure the "Unlatch" option is checked under "Access Level Configuration".<br>
<br>
Unlatching can be triggered using the lock.open service.<br>
<br>
Alternatively an "Unlatch" button is exposed through Home Assistant discovery.<br>
This button is disabled by default, but can be enabled in the Home Assistant UI.

### When controlling two locks (or openers) connected to two ESPs, both devices react to the same command. When using Home Asistant, the same status is display for both locks.

When using multiple Nuki devices, different paths for each device have to be configured.<br>
Navigate to "MQTT Configuration" and change the "MQTT Nuki Hub Path" under "Basic MQTT Configuration" for at least one of the devices.<br>

### The Nuki battery is draining quickly.

This often is a result of enabling "Register as app" when not using [Hybrid mode](/HYBRID.md) (Official MQTT / Nuki Hub co-existance).<br>
Doing so will cause Nuki Hub to constantly query the lock and as such cause excessive battery drain.<br>
To prevent this behaviour, unpair Nuki Hub, disable "Register as app", and re-pair.<br>
<br>
<b>Never enable "Register as app" unless you intend to use a Nuki Bridge in addition to Nuki Hub or you are using Hybrid mode!</b>
